<h2>Bambarakanda Falls</h2>

Despite its grandeur, Bambarakanda maintains a tranquil atmosphere, making it a peaceful destination for hikers, nature lovers, and photographers.

<h2>Diyaluma Falls</h2>
<p>
Diyaluma Falls, standing at 220 meters (720 feet), is the second-highest waterfall in Sri Lanka. It is located near Koslanda in the Badulla District and is one of the most iconic and photographed waterfalls in the country. The falls cascade down a steep rock face in a single vertical sheet before splashing into the rocks below, creating a stunning visual spectacle especially during the rainy season.
</p>
<p>
What sets Diyaluma apart is the series of natural rock pools found at the top of the falls. Many adventurous travelers hike to the top to swim in these pools and enjoy breathtaking views of the valley below. The blend of adventure, relaxation, and natural beauty makes Diyaluma a popular destination for backpackers and nature enthusiasts. However, care must be taken at the top, as the rocks can be slippery and the drop extremely steep.

<h2>Dunhinda Falls</h2>
<p>
Dunhinda Falls is considered one of the most beautiful waterfalls in Sri Lanka. Located near the city of Badulla, it falls gracefully from a height of 64 meters (210 feet) into a large pool surrounded by dense forest.

<p>
A 1.5 km trek through forest trails leads to the waterfall, offering a peaceful walk rich in bird calls and lush greenery. Dunhinda is not just a scenic wonder but also holds a place in local lore and history, having once been a site of ancient settlements.
